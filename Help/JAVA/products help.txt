Let's break down the provided JavaScript code:

1. **Product Data Array**:
   - `const products = [ ... ];`: Defines an array named `products` that holds information about each product. Each product is represented as an object containing properties such as name, category, brand, price, image, specifications, and discount price.

2. **Display Products Function**:
   - `function displayProducts(productList) { ... }`: Defines a function named `displayProducts` that takes a list of products as input.
     - This function dynamically generates HTML code to display the products on the webpage.
     - It iterates over the list of products using the `forEach` method.
     - For each product, it creates HTML elements for displaying the product image, name, specifications, price, and sale indicator (if applicable).
     - The generated HTML is then appended to the `#productList` element in the HTML document.

3. **Initial Display of Products**:
   - `displayProducts(products);`: Calls the `displayProducts` function with the entire `products` array as the input. This ensures that all products are displayed initially when the page loads.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - `$('#searchInput').on('input', function() { ... });`: Listens for input in the search box (`#searchInput`).
     - When the user types in the search box, this function is triggered.
     - It retrieves the search term entered by the user using `$(this).val().toLowerCase()`.
     - It filters the products based on the entered search term (product name) using the `filter` method.
     - The filtered products are then displayed on the webpage using the `displayProducts` function.

5. **Filter by Category**:
   - `$('#categoryFilter').change(function() { ... });`: Listens for changes in the category filter dropdown (`#categoryFilter`).
     - When the user selects a category, this function is triggered.
     - It retrieves the selected category using `$(this).find(':selected').data('category')`.
     - It filters the products based on the selected category using the `filter` method.
     - The filtered products are then displayed on the webpage using the `displayProducts` function.

6. **Filter by Brand**:
   - `$('#brandFilter').change(function() { ... });`: Listens for changes in the brand filter dropdown (`#brandFilter`).
     - When the user selects a brand, this function is triggered.
     - It retrieves the selected brand using `$(this).find(':selected').data('brand')`.
     - It filters the products based on the selected brand using the `filter` method.
     - The filtered products are then displayed on the webpage using the `displayProducts` function.

This JavaScript code provides functionality for dynamically displaying products, searching for products, and filtering products based on category or brand on the webpage.
